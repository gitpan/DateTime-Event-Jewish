DateTime-Event-Jewish

This modules does two jobs:
1. To enable you to find the leyning
for any Shabbat in the year. Given a Gregorian date, it returns
the either a parshah name or a yom tov name.
2. To calculate the time of Shabbat and other halachically
interesting times.

BUGS

This module uses DateTime::Calendar::Hebrew. This module does not
quite live up to its documentation and, at least at version
0.04, does not even install cleanly. You need to do a little bit
of hacking.

Fixes to DateTime-Calendar-Hebrew-0.04/Hebrew.pm:

1. Install the module by hand using 'force install' in the CPAN command.

2. Locate Hebrew.pm in your installed library and edit it as below:

sub utc_rd_values {
        my $self = shift;
-       return @{$self}{ qw/rd_days rd_secs rd_nanosecs/ };
+       my @res = @{$self}{ qw/rd_days rd_secs rd_nanosecs/ };
+       $res[2] ||= 0;
+       return @res;
}

-sub time_zone { 'floating' } 
+use DateTime::TimeZone::Floating qw( );
+sub time_zone { DateTime::TimeZone::Floating->new() }
