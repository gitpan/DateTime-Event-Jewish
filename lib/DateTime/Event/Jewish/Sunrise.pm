=head1 NAME

DateTime::Event::Jewish::Sunrise - Calculate halachically
interesting times

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use DateTime::Event::Jewish::Sunrise ;

my $jerusalem	= DateTime::Event::Jewish::Sunrise->new([31,34,57], [35,13,0]), 'Asia/Jerusalem';
my $date	= DateTime->new(year=>2010, month=>3, day=>30);

my $shkia	= $jerusalem->shkia($date);
my $shabbat	= $jerusalem->kabbalatShabbat($date);
my $netz	= $jerusalem->netzHachama($date);
my $night	= $jerusalem->motzeiShabbat($date);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module assumes that the earth is a smooth sphere. No
allowance is made for atmospheric refraction or diffraction of
light passing close to the earth's surface. To allow for
refraction one uses a depression of 0.833 degrees (50' arc). As,
by default, we use 1 degree of depression this is more than adequate.

The methods that return times actually return a DateTime
object in the correct timezone as specified in the constructor. 
If an evaluation fails, e.g. no sunrise inside the Arctic cirle,
undef is returned.

All times are corrected for the equation of time: the variation
between sundial time and clock time.

If you call this module for a high latitude in the height of
summer or the depth of winter it will return nonsense. Ask a silly
question and you will get a very silly answer.

Calculations are done using the spherical cosine rule.

=head3 new($latitude, $longitude, $timeZone)

Constructs a new object.

=over

=item $latitude

An arrayref of three numbers representing degrees, minutes and
seconds of latitude. North latitudes are positive, south
latitudes are negative.

=item $Longitude

An arrayref of three numbers representing degrees, minutes and
seconds of longitude. East longitudes are positive, west
longitudes are negative.

=item $timeZone

A time-zone name as stored in the time-zone database, e.g.
"Europe/London".

=back

=cut

sub new {
	my $class	= shift;
	my ($lat, $long, $zone)	= @_;
	my $self	= {lat=>$lat, long=>$long, zone=>$zone};
	bless $self, $class;
}


=head3 halachicHalfDay($date, [$extra])

Calculates the length of the halachic half day in minutes. This
is half the time between sunrise and sunset.

If you call this method for a high latitude in the height of
summer or the depth of winter it will return 0. Ask a silly
question and you will get a very silly answer.

=over 


=item $date

A DateTime object, either a Gregoorian or a Hebrew date.
Only the day and month are relevant.

=item $extra

The number of degrees below the tangent plane that the sun
should be at halachic sunrise/set. Default 1.

=item returns

The length of the half-day in minutes. Returns 0 if there is no
sensible answer, e.g. inside the Arctic circle in summer.

=head3 halfday($date, [$as])

the given location on the specified day of the year.
i.e. the time when the sun is 90 degrees from the zenith.

=over 

=item $date

A DateTime object. Only the day and month are relevant.
N.B. This is a Gregorian date.

=item Returns

The length of the ahlf day in minutes. Returns 0 if there is no
sensible answer, e.g. inside the ARctic circle in summer.

should be at halachic sunrise/set. Default 1.

before shkia, though some people use 18 minutes.

=over 

=item $date

A DateTime object specifying the Gregorian date that we are interested in.

=item $extra

=head3 motzeiShabbat($date, [$extra])

Motzei Shabbat according to R Tam is 72 mins after shkia.
More conventionally we use the time when the sun is
either  7degs or 8 degs or 8.5 degs below the horizon.
Some people even use 11 or 14 degrees, but this quickly becomes
ridiculous in even moderate latitudes.

For fast ends we use 6 degs (R Schneur Zalman).

return value is a proper coordinate tuple.

#    recalculated into degrees, minutes and seconds.
